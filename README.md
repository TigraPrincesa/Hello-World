# Hello-World

Hello. 
Does anybody need a partner? 
I am new to GitHub so, I am hoping that I join a team to become accutomed to this community. I've been coding JavaScript for a while now. I wouldn't say that I am intermediate nor expertee, rather a beginner who knows little about  coding. Perhaps, someone can help me. I would really appreciate it. 

                             sincerely, 
                                        Tigra
